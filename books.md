## Recommended books

  * **Frantisek Franek** - *Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++*: This is an excellent book that provides a comprehensive picture on the role of memory in programming. Once you have learned how to write simple programs in C or C++ (which obviously should involve dynamic memory management) this book will help you understand what really happens in the background.
